Description: dist(x) in base R only has a few methods.
  If you want to calculate distance with some arbitrary measure
  (eg simple matching coefficient, or cosine distance), then too bad for you.
  This package creates all pairwise comparisons between samples and calculates
  the distance with any arbitrary distance function. Using the foreach package,
  this calculation is done in parallel.
